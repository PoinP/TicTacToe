# TicTacToe

A simple program written in an afternoon that allows you to play against the computer or a friend of yours.

It uses the well known minimax algorithm with the help of alpha-beta pruning.

#### Dependencies:

* The program uses PySimpleGUI in order to display the UI
* You need to have tkinter installed as well

Tested on Windows and Linux

#### TODO:

* Would love to add networking functionality some day so you can play against a friend on the other side of the globe
